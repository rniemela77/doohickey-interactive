## About
- This is a fun project I did to show off some sweet front-end skills.

- It features a handful of puzzles, visual effects, audio, and a hint of a hint of a storyline.


# Install

```
npm install
```

# Development

```
npm run dev
```

### Potential improvements:
- need to make sure that puzzle hint setTimeout clears when puzzle is completed
- not obvious enough that the user has to "wipe" only part of the screen during that part of the quiz, maybe we have them wipe the entire screen and not just the keypad
- audio lag on mobile, perhaps we can preload audio to fix this
- re-downloading audio files, perhaps we can download once and clone/replay it on demand
- puzzles can be too confusing, perhaps we can add more hints
- keypad entry sometimes won't show more than 1 number after a entered few failures
- need to add audio controls
- need to add footer or more info to settings for an "about"
